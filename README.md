# New-Visions-Assessment

- I created a React front end environment to display the data. 
- The page contains: the original data of students, followed by the students sorted by grade.
- To display the students with the lowest average click the button "Get lowest Avg"

The assessment can be view at : https://reverent-northcutt-1c6978.netlify.com/

The results of the assessment can also be checked in the console, using the file: Assessment.js
